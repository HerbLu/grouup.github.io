  <h1>Ultraman Tiga</h1>
<p id="pp">Ultraman Tiga (ウルトラマンティガ Urutoraman Tiga) is the eponymous Ultra Hero of Ultraman Tiga. He is notable for being the first Ultraman in the franchise to be able to change forms, as well as ending a 15 year hiatus of full-length series since Ultraman 80.</p>

<p id="pp">Tiga was once one of the Ultra-Ancient Giants of Light who came to the Earth as light, from a certain nebula far away. He and his race fought against monsters such as Golza to protect the Ultra-Ancient Civilization on R'lyeh 30 million years ago, but eventually Tiga and a few others found the power of "darkness", and gained a great power, becoming evil Giants of Darkness of which Tiga was the strongest at the time. A civil war broke out between the Ultras, and the ancient civilization they once protected became a battlefield and graveyard for many of them. Eventually, Yuzare somehow convinced Tiga to follow the path of light again. Tiga defeated Darramb, Hudra, and his former lover Camearra and took their powers, gaining his Type Changes. He also sealed them as stone statues in the R'lyeh ruins.</p>

<p id="pp">After the ancient human permutation,Tiga's body laid petrified in the golden pyramid and was discovered when the TPC's expert team GUTS was dispatched to search for the pyramid spoken of in a holographic message from the ancient civilization. They intended to find Tiga in a last ditch effort to stop the two beasts that had appeared; Melba and Golza. However, the two beasts destroyed the pyramid and began to destroy the petrified Ultra beings. Before Tiga could be destroyed, he was rejuvenated when he merged with the GUTS pilot Daigo Madoka who had turned into light, and quickly destroyed Melba, while Golza fled.</p>

<p id="pp">Tiga would continue to serve Earth, albeit without his Ultra comrades. Later on the holographic message told Daigo that he and Tiga were one and the same, implying that he was once Tiga in a past life. As time passes, Tiga would face powerful opponents such as Gagi, Gobnu, Kyrieloid, Weaponizer, Evil Tiga, Zoiger, and other enemies sometimes with or without the aid of GUTS.</p>

<p id="pp">As Tiga's time on Earth began to draw to a close, the servants of Darkness began to attack. The first of these was Gijera a servant of the darkness itself that threatened to drown humanity in a dreamlike euphoria. Whereas the Tiga of the past could do nothing to stop Gijera because the humans at the time would rather accept it and their coming destruction rather than live their difficult human lives, the Tiga of the present was, as Yuzare said, "a human and the light", which Daigo interpreted as the ability to forge a path of his own despite being Tiga, and defeated Gijera. Nook and Terra note that the is the first giant of light to have interfered with the humans' decisions, but thanks him for it. The final servant of darkness was Zoiger, who Tiga destroyed with great difficulty, almost faced with defeat. Tiga's final battle took place upon the appearance of Gatanothor; the master of all darkness which Gijera and Zoiger bowed to. Tiga was defeated by the evil lord and was petrified once again, but he was later revived by the hopes of the children of the world which transformed them into beings of light to merge with the Titan. This rejuvenation allowed Tiga to transform into his Glitter form with tremendous power and destroy the evil god. However, Tiga's victory came at a cost: Daigo lost his power and couldn't transform to Ultraman Tiga anymore as the Sparklence disintegrated into dust. However, Daigo tells Rena he believes that every human could also become light with their own power.</p>
